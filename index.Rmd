### **Student Research Opportunities: Overview**

<br>


#### **Why research?**

The psychology department at Farmingdale State College has several research opportunities available for students. Research is an integral part of learning, growth and development. Seniors in the Applied Psychology program have the option to take on a role as a research assistant, or develop their own research with a faculty mentor. However, there is no reason to wait until senior year to explore research as an avenue of interest. The Applied Psychology program will prepare you for graduate study, coupled with research experience, this will make you an excellent candidate for whichever university you intend to study at after graduating.

#### **What can I research?**

Our faculty have various backgrounds and areas of interests, including but not limited to: cognitive psychology, industrial orginizational psychology, biopsychology, developmental psychology, and clinical psychology. For a more in depth view, head over to the People tab to see which areas each faculty member specializes in. 
<br>

#### **What if my research interests do not match?**

You may not see your exact interests, but if it falls under the scope of one of the above domains, the faculty will always be supportive and do their best to help you. 


#### **What is required of me to participate in research?**


Time. While there are other requirements of you, your time and devotion is of the upmost importance. Research requires a lot of meticulous work. The benefits are tremendous, but you need to make sure that you can devote a consistent amount of time to whomever you work under.
<br>
Regardless of which field your mentor works in, if you are working with human participants you will need to complete [IRB Training](https://www.citiprogram.org/default.asp) and attain a certificate of completion. Each research institution and university has a dedicated Institutional Review Board (IRB) that exists to ensure that the research being done has a clear purpose, and is of no harm to the those that participate.
