I graduated from [CUNY Brooklyn College](http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/schools/naturalsciences/graduate/psychology/experimental.php) with an MA in experimental psychology. During my time at Brooklyn College I researched the role that emotions play in moral judgments. Specifically, I was interested in seeing how anger is related to judgment of an action itself, and how disgust is related to judgment of the character *of* the actor. 

In the Fall I will be starting a new position at [Farmingdale State College](https://www.farmingdale.edu/arts-sciences/psychology/applied-psychology/index.shtml) as an adjunct professor. Additionally, I will be the lab manager for the Psychology Department. 

My research interests are centered on perception, memory, attention, morality, and religion.
