I like to learn new things, and I like to chronicle my learning so that those looking for an answer may stumble across this site and find something to help. My main goals at the moment are performing more advanced statistical analyses with R-Studio and using PsychToolBox to create behavioral experiments. 

Currently, I am an Adjunct Professor and Lab Manager at [Farmingdale State College](www.farmingdale.edu). Teaching is something relatively new to me, but it is something I really enjoy!

I am interested in several areas of research; religion, perception, morality, and emotions.
